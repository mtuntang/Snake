# Snake
An iteration of the classic snake game made with C# using the Windows Form Framework in Visual Studio.

## How to play?
1. Click "Code" then "Download Zip"
2. Go to Snake/Classic Snake/Classic Snake/bin/Debug/ and click on "Classic Snake.exe".

## What's different?
1. Instead of starting over with a tiny danger noodle, you get the choice to continue with your previous run's snek by clicking "Start" after you died. Your score will start from 0 however :)
2. If the game is getting too hard because your danger noodle is a big snek and keeps hitting its body, you can click "Reset" to start over with a tiny danger noodle.

## Warning
Things can get chaotic if you don't reset after awhile. If your snek respawns and keeps hitting its body, clicking "Reset" is a good idea.
